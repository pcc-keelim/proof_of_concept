This folder contains the code needed to create fake data that is similar in distribution to that observed in production 

To generate the data just run `parquet_file_gen.ipynb'.`

It will generate the needed data in the `data/` folder and then create a file called `database.duckdb` which will contain views pointing to the fake data generated.
